# redefstats
Redefine yourself

## USAGE

copy config.sample.py to config.py and set the variables so you can run this yourself

* you must be a member of /r/Redefinition for this to work. 
* Run `gen_stats.py` to create the data file
* After that the Javascript will be able to load it
* Note it won't work by opening it with the file:/// protocol due to CORS restrictions unless you copy the contents of data.json into the `var data` variable in index.html
